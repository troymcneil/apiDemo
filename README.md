# Brightwheel Exercise

## Thank you for your consideration!

A couple of notes:

1. I used VUE 3 for this project as that is the framework I am most comfortable with
2. I tried to stick to the 2-3 hour suggestion and so I did not have time to write tests. 
3. If you have any questions you can email me at troymcneil@hey.com.


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### To Run the App
```
npm run web
```


Thank you!
